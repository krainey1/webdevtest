    <h1>Operators</h1>
    <h4>Now that you can print (at least a little) let's talk about operators. Operators are the symbols that tell the compiler to do a specific operation. Like the arithmetic operators that we'll start with first.</h4>

    <h4> For instance the + is the operator for addition (Notice we don't use quotation marks here, we are not declaring the string object but rather numbers)</h4>
    <div class="boxed">
        console.log(2 + 2); (would return 4)
    </div>

    <h4>And - is the symbol for subtraction</h4>
    <div class="boxed">
        console.log(4 - 2);(would return 2)
    </div>

    <h4>The asterisk * is used for multiplication</h4>
    <div class="boxed">
        console.log(2 * 2); (would return 4)
    </div>

    <h4>And the foward slash / is used for division</h4>
    <div class="boxed">
        console.log(4 / 2); (would return 2)
    </div>

    <h4>Another operator worth noting is modulus % which returns the remainder of a value</h4>
    <div class="boxed">
        console.log(5 % 2); (would return 1)
    </div>

    <h4>There are also increment operators ++ and -- that can increment a value by adding 1 or subtracting 1. This will become more important later when working with variable values.</h4>
    <h4>Got all that? Awesome. There are a few more operators you might want to become familiar with later, such as assignment operators for variables. (we'll get to it soon!) </h4>
