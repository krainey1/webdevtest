    <h1>Working with Loops</h1>
    <h4>In this section we are going to focus on two types of loops: for and while loops. But why use a loop? Well you would want to use a loop if you need to perform a task (like printing!) more than once so you don't have to write the code out line by line. </h4>
    <h4>You would want to use a for loop if you want to do something a set amount of times. A for loop looks like this:</h4>
    <div class="boxed">
        for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++)<br>
        {<br>
        &ensp; (code segment here)<br>
        }
    </div>
    <h4>With the code checking i to make sure it's less than 10 before executing the code if it is. The i++ increments i as each iteration is executed. So once i is 10 the code within the for loop will no longer execute. </h4>
    <h4>Another loop is the while loop, which is a loop that will keep going as long as the condition is true. It look's like this:</h4>
    <div class="boxed">
        while(condition)<br>
        {<br>
        &ensp; (code to be executed while condition is true)<br>
        }<br>
    </div>
    <h4>And that's all for loops. There's actually a couple more types of loops worth noting, so look at some documentation if you want to know more! <br>And that's it for the basics! To continue I reccomend material from places like W3Schools, Codeacademy, and the JavaScript docs for more info. Happy coding!</h4>
