Trying out some webdev, feel free to look around

Current Notes:
* Background color does not stay the same between pages when set with button
* working towards using localStorage to fix
* More stuff to add soon: tile menu, fixed text, etc.
* Functional Seach Bar ~ Implement @ home (dont have access to google control panel from school)

Recent Additions (3/1):
* Responsive Menu Bar
* Search Bar (as of now not functional)
* Styles for both bars
